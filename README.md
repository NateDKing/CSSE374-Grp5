TODO: Create sample set of classes that 
 
 
-get ALL classes, not just example

-how to tell if decorator or singleton

SINGLETON
-private constructor
-private static instance variable of Singleton in question
-private constructor with public method calling constructor so others can access it

DECORATOR
-takes interface(extends) or abstract class(implements) and adds it as an instance variable
  -constructor takes component
-calls new method on class extended/implemented

should just need to look at fields in needed areas to discern between the two in our code, doesn't seem too bad
